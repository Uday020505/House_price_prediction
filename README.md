House Price Prediction using Linear Regression


Overview->

This project implements a House Price Prediction System using Linear Regression built from scratch in Python.
The model predicts house prices based on key features such as area, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, age of the property, and location rating.

This project demonstrates fundamental concepts of:

Machine Learning
Linear Regression
Gradient Descent
Model evaluation
Feature importance analysis



Features ->

Train Linear Regression model from scratch (no external ML libraries)

Predict house price for new input data

Display model weights and bias

Calculate average prediction error

Compare sample house predictions

Show feature importance visualization (text-based)

Save prediction report to a .txt file

Interactive menu-based system



Input Features ->

The model uses the following features:

Feature	Description
Area	Size of house (sq ft)
Bedrooms	Number of bedrooms
Bathrooms	Number of bathrooms
Age	Age of the house (years)
Location	Location rating (1–10)
Project Structure
house_price_prediction.py
README.md



How It Works ->

Load sample training data

Initialize model weights and bias

Train model using Gradient Descent

Evaluate model performance

Predict prices for new houses

Generate reports and insights



How to Run ->

Step 1: Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/house-price-prediction.git

Step 2: Navigate to project folder
cd house-price-prediction

Step 3: Run the script
python house_price_prediction.py

Sample Output

Training progress with error reduction

Model weights for each feature
